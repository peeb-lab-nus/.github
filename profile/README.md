Based at the National University of Singapore (NUS), our lab studies how the ecological and evolutionary processes that underlie present-day patterns in plant biodiversity and ecosystems dynamics are shaped by their ever-changing biotic and abiotic context. Our work is multi-disciplinary and combines field-based ecology, cutting-edge sequencing approaches, big biodiversity data, and the development of new analytical and simulation models. We hope these insights will inform the conservation of tropical ecosystems and biodiversity.
